                <p>For many years Ive had the privilege to visit nursing homes as I truly enjoy spending time with the
                    elderly. I sing and teach Bible studies and appreciate hearing about their former lives. The Lord
                    has
                    allowed me to make some precious friendships and I want to share with you about a lovely lady who
                    after
                    a devastating stroke was no longer able to be independent and is now in a comfortable setting where
                    she
                    is well taken care of. I love talking with Barbara and a while back in the middle of one of her
                    stories
                    we discovered that long ago she was actually my mother s next-door neighbor and they played together
                    as
                    children.</p>

                    <p>Most people set several goals every year, but most of them go unfulfilled. To make sure that your
                        dream life becomes a reality, you should take some time to learn how to create personal and
                        career
                        goals that suit the life you want to create. </p>
